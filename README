Instructions for creating a "League Of Pi" laptop build.

[1] Download the latest Raspbian X86 desktop image:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/


[2] Burn this onto a USB stick using etcher:

https://www.balena.io/etcher/


[3] Install the image to your laptop:

a. plug your USB stick into your laptop (powered down)
b. power your laptop on and boot it into the USB media 
NOTE: USB boot is a setting you will find in your BIOS
c. select graphical install
d. accept all default settings
e. ignore complaints about missing licensed components


[4] Open a terminal and type "cd /home/pi/Desktop"


[5] Download the repository. In the same terminal window, type:

wget https://github.com/SMPSCodeClub/LeagueOfPi/archive/master.zip


[6] Once the download has completed, type "unzip master.zip"


[7] Choose a NAME for your laptop and run the build script:

e.g. ./LeagueOfPi-master/BUILD/build.sh ManicMiner


Now wait as the build script does the following:
1. renames your laptop
2. updates the OS (apt-get update; apt-get upgrade)
3. adds /media/pi symlink to desktop (for ease of finding USB media) 
4. installs additional offline goodies (e.g. Inkscape, GIMP...)
5. adds applications to the menu system
